## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap] https://getbootstrap.com/


### What I learned

I learned how to use the bootstrap grids.


### Useful resources

- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius/) - This helped me because the border radius for the "row" class did not want to work for me. The children elements had always edges without rounding. I had to add in my CSS file the 'overflow:hidden;' property and after that it worked.
